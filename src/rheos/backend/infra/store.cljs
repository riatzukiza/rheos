  "Minimal IStore driver protocol for kanban persistence.

   This is a local, lightweight abstraction inspired by the sol-extraction
   IStore idea. EdnStore is the only production-ready driver today; the
   protocol shape leaves room for a MongoStore later without changing callers.

   Full migration of task/config loading to use IStore is intentionally
   descoped: markdown task files and JSON board configs are loaded directly
   because their shapes are stable and the extra driver layer would not pay
   for itself at the current scale. Views are small, keyed documents, so they
   are a natural fit for the protocol."
